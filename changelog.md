# Revision history for tasty-hedgehog

## 1.4.0.0 -- 2022-10-12

* Support `hedgehog-1.2`. This is a breaking change due to `hedgehog`'s [new mechanism for skipping to a particular test and shrink result](https://github.com/hedgehogqa/haskell-hedgehog/pull/454). The `--hedgehog-replay` option now expects a `Skip` value and a `Seed`, for example: `stack test --test-arguments='--pattern "$NF ~ /badReverse involutive fails/" --hedgehog-replay "3:b2 Seed 10332913068362713902 1302058653756691475"'` ([#63](https://github.com/qfpl/tasty-hedgehog/pull/63))

## 1.3.1.0 -- 2022-10-03

* The instructions for reproducing test failures are now more clearly distinguished from `hedgehog`'s own instructions and include a pattern in the example to limit which tests are re-run. ([#62](https://github.com/qfpl/tasty-hedgehog/pull/62))

## 1.3.0.0 -- 2022-08-22

* The `testProperty` function has been undeprecated. Its behaviour differs from that in version `1.1.0.0` and below in that it now passes no `PropertyName` to Hedgehog. Therefore, Hedgehog will render the text `<property>` in its instructions for reproducing test failures, as opposed to whatever description is provided for `testProperty`.

## 1.2.0.0 -- 2022-03-07

* Add `testPropertyNamed` function and deprecate `testProperty`.
